# Software-Security-305

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is a financial services company who was looking for assistance with their software security.
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    What I did well was finding the vulnerabilities and finding a way for them to be solved. Coding securely is very important since it can cause important information from the company or customer to be leaked. Software security is imporant to a company's overall wellbeing because it keeps the companys data safe as well as the customers who use it.
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    The part of the vulnerability assessment that was helpful was learning how to conduct a vulnerability assessment is because this is important for any code you make.
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    To increase layers of security firsly I added a multi-factor authentication which is important at keeping unwanted access at bay. I would use the same vulnerabilitie assessment because it is very reliable other than the false flags.
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    I made sure the code and software were functional and secure by running the code and then using the vulnerability assessment too see what vulnerabilities there are. After refactoring the code I would then do another vulnerability assessment to check for new vulnerabilities.
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    The vulnerability assessment is now a must use tool for me since it makes it much easier too find them and solve them.
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I would show them that I know how to check for vulnerabilites and use that to fix them making the code I make much more secure.
